# Music-Automatic
 Streamlined sorting and reorganization of music folders on the computer through advanced automation

**Plans to carry out**:
- Automatic conversion of corrupted metadata
- Removing duplicate songs with smart detection
(in double singles - removal of the lower quality copy)
- Adding a name by title and vice versa, with a priority check
(names that contain the word strip instead of the name of a song, for example)
Using machine learning?
- Overview with recommendations for implementation
- Search for video files that take up space
- Search for files with a high bit rate, with an option to shrink
- Converting files with an undefined name in English (for example: "track") to a corresponding name in Hebrew (such as: "רצועה")
