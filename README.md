# Music-Automatic
 Streamlined sorting and reorganization of music folders on the computer through advanced automation

**Plans to carry out**:
- Automatic conversion of corrupted metadata✅
- Search and identify duplicate music folders and clean them
- Removing duplicate songs with smart detection
(in double singles - removal of the lower quality copy)
- Adding a name by title and vice versa, with a priority check
(names that contain the word "רצועה" instead of a song name for example)
- Overview with recommendations for implementation
- Search for video files that take up space
- Search for files with a high bit rate, with an option to shrink
- Converting files with an undefined name in English (for example: "track") to a corresponding name in Hebrew (such as: "רצועה")✅
